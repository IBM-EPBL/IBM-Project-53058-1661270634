    <p><b>Wind power or wind energy is mostly the use of wind turbines to generate electricity. Wind power is a popular, sustainable, renewable energy source that has a much smaller impact on the environment than burning fossil fuels. Historically, wind power has been used in sails, windmills and windpumps but today it is mostly used to generate electricity. Wind farms consist of many individual wind turbines, which are connected to the electric power transmission network.Wind energy conversion devices like wind turbines are used for converting wind energy into mechanical energy. Wind turbines consist basically of a few sails, vanes or blades radiating from a central axis. When wind blows against the blades or vanes, they rotate about the axis. This rotational motion is utilised to perform some useful work. By connecting the wind turbine to an electric generator wind energy can be con­verted into electric energy.
        In India, winds are relatively low (5 km/hr to 15/20 km/hr) and vary appreci­ably with season. This makes the exploitation of wind energy an expensive project.</b></p>
